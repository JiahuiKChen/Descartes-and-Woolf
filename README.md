# Descartes-and-Woolf: 
### An interactive website where the writing style, subject matter, and presentation differences between Descartes' and Woolf's works can be seen based on the input given by a user.  

Website information on functionality is [here](https://descartes-and-woolf.appspot.com/about).  

This website was created as an [Unessay](http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay#about) project, for [Professor Elizabeth Callaway](http://www.elizabethcallaway.net/)'s class.  

More details on the literary argument behind the website are in the Artist's Statement.
