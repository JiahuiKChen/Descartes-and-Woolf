    A website where the works of Descartes and Woolf can be searched,

    and text in the style of Descartes and Woolf can be generated

  <p class="h4">Descartes and Woolf both wrote about introspective experiences,</p>
  <p class="h4">but their very different writing style, subject matter, and presentation</p>
  <p class="h4">result in drastically different expressions of introspection.</p>

      This website is a tool used to show differences between the writing of Descartes and Woolf
      <br>
      through the text search and generation functions.
      <br><br>
      <strong><u>Search Function:</u></strong>
      <br>
      Search results are sentences and excerpts from Descartes' and Woolf's works.
      <br>
      When inspecting the search results, style differences (punctuation, word choice, sentence lengths, etc.),
      subject matter differences (subject of introspection, etc.),
      and presentation differences (genre, point of view, etc.)
      between the writing of the two authors can be seen.
      <br><br>
      <strong><u>Generation Function:</u></strong>
      <br>
      DescartesBot and WoolfBot are generative Markove Chain models (created via
      <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify" target="_blank">Markovify</a>).
      <br>
      They were given works of Descartes and Woolf and subsequently can generate random sentences
      in the style of Descartes and Woolf, respectively.
      <br>
      When inspecting the original text generated by the textbot, the same style,
      subject matter, and presentation differences mentioned above can be seen (to an extent...).
      <br><br>
